# DMD-Denoiser_with-BM3D
In this project with the help of the BM3D model Image reconstruction has been accomplished. To reconstruct the image, a DMD was simulated with Python, different conventional methods were used to reconstruct and the output was compared with each other as images.

The content of the google drive that I used is on the GitHub you can see the files in the repo. The main code that I did everything to is `BM3D_ADMM_Code.ipynb`.
